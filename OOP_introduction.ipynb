        "# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-oriented programming (OOP) can be a tough concept for many to grasp. It introduces a modular, often abstract way of thinking that doesn’t always feel intuitive. Unlike more straightforward Python concepts like loops or binary search, where the form and purpose of the code are often clear, OOP introduces layers that can feel cryptic. For instance, the ubiquitous `self` parameter can be puzzling—when to use it, how, and why are common points of confusion. Then there are “dunder” methods (like `__init__`), which add to the foreign-language feel, making OOP seem like a mystery of its own, and all this in a field that’s already complex!\n",
        "\n",
        "In this entry, I'll try to help make sense of this programming style and hope it helps anyone struggling with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key OOP Terms and Definitions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class**  \n",
        "   A blueprint or template for creating objects (**instances**). A class defines attributes and methods that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "   class Car:\n",
        "       pass  # Defines a Car class\n",
        "```\n",
        "2. **Object**\n",
        "An instance of a class. When a class is defined, objects can be created from it. Each object is unique but follows the structure defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "`my_car = Car()  # Creates an instance (object) of the Car class`\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Attribute**\n",
        "A variable that belongs to an object or class. Attributes store the data related to the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
        "        self.make = make  # 'make' is an attribute\n",
        "        self.model = model  # 'model' is an attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Method**\n",
        "A function that belongs to a class. Methods define the behavior of an object and can access or modify its attributes.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def start(self):\n",
        "        return \"Car is starting\"\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "5. **`self`**\n",
        "A reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access the object's attributes and methods. It is passed automatically in method definitions and is used to refer to the object calling the method.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make):\n",
        "        self.make = make  # 'self' refers to the instance of Car\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Constructor (`__init__`)**\n",
        "A special method that is automatically called when a new object is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
        "        self.make = make\n",
        "        self.model = model\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "The practice of keeping an object's data (attributes) safe from outside interference by controlling access to it. This is often done by using private and protected attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make):\n",
        "        self.__make = make  # Private attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Inheritance**\n",
        "A mechanism where one class (child or subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass), allowing code reuse.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class ElectricCar(Car):  # Inherits from Car class\n",
        "    def charge(self):\n",
        "        return \"Charging the electric car\"\n",

        "        return \"Charging the electric car\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Polymorphism**\n",
        "The ability to define methods in different classes with the same name but different implementations. It allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly based on shared behavior.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",

        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Abstraction**\n",
        "The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. Abstraction is often used to create a simple interface for interacting with complex systems.\n",
        "```\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal(ABC):\n",

        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Inheritance** (`super()`)\n",
        "The `super()` function allows a child class to call a method from its parent class, enabling code reuse from the parent class while allowing the child class to add or modify functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "class ElectricCar(Car):\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model, battery):\n",

        "\n",
        "13. **Private Attribute**\n",
        "An attribute that cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. In Python, private attributes are marked with a double underscore (`__`).\n",

        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **Public Attribute**\n",
        "An attribute that can be accessed from outside the class. In Python, public attributes do not have any special syntax and can be freely accessed.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Car:\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **Protected Attribute**\n",
        "An attribute that is intended to be accessed only within the class and its subclasses. By convention, protected attributes are prefixed with a single underscore (`_`).\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **Instance Method**\n",
        "A method that operates on the attributes of a specific object (`instance`). It always takes self as its first parameter, which refers to the object calling the method.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def drive(self):\n",
        "        return f\"{self.make} is driving\"\n",

        "\n",
        "18. **Class Method**\n",
        "A method that is bound to the class and not the object. It can modify class-level attributes. It is marked with the `@classmethod` decorator and takes `cls` (class itself) as the first argument.\n",

        "\n",
        "20. **Duck Typing**\n",
        "A concept in Python where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. If an object has the required methods, it can be used in place of another object, regardless of its actual type.\n",

        "### When to Use `self`:\n",
        "1. In Class Methods: You use `self` in every method in a class **that needs to access or modify the object’s attributes**.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Computer:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, cpu):\n",
        "        self.make = make  # 'self.make' refers to the instance's make attribute\n",

        "    def process_time(self):\n",
        "        return f\"Your {self.make} has a {self.cpu} processor\"`\n",
        "```\n",
        "2. **When You Want to Store or Retrieve Data:** Any time you're working with instance variables (attributes specific to each object), *use `self` to refer to them*.\n",
        "```\n",
        "def change_make(self, new_make):\n",
        "    self.make = new_make  # Updates the 'make' attribute of the object\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. When Calling Other Methods Inside the Class: You use self to call other methods within the same object.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Computer:\n",
        "    def start(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Starting the computer...\")\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def process(self):\n",
        "        self.start()  # Using 'self' to call another method within the same class\n",
        "```\n",
        "### Why Can’t We Skip `self`?\n",
        "If you don't include self, Python wouldn't know which object’s data you're referring to. For example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "def __init__(make, cpu):  # Missing 'self'\n",
        "    self.make = make  # This would cause an error, because 'self' is not defined\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## To Sum It Up\n",
        "Summary:\n",
        "1. `self` is a reference to the current object.\n",
        "2. You must use `self` in every instance method of a class to access or modify the object's attributes.\n",
        "3. `self` is always the first parameter in instance methods, though it doesn’t need to be passed manually when calling the method (Python handles this automatically).\n",
