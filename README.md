# 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Explorations

## 🚀 Overview

This repository dives into the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python. It serves as a hands-on resource to reinforce OOP fundamentals through real code, examples, and interactive notebooks.

Whether you're new to OOP or brushing up your Python skills, this repo lays the groundwork for more advanced object-oriented design and software architecture.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build intuition for classes, instances, and methods.
- Understand encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Use decorators like `@property` for clean interfaces.
- Apply OOP concepts to practical, reusable code examples.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To try things out locally:

```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/christophergaughan/OOP.git
cd OOP
```

# Optional: create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

# Install dependencies if needed
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Run a Python script
`python 7.1-class_property.py`

# Or open notebooks
`jupyter notebook`

## Learning Outcomes

By working through this repo, you will:

- Write custom classes with meaningful `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__` methods.
- Use inheritance to reduce redundancy and extend functionality.
- Protect and expose internal data cleanly using `@property` decorators.
- Build confidence writing clean, modular, and reusable code.
