    "# OOP Programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) is often difficult for some to learn. I think it has to do with the modular nature of this programming style, adding to the fact that some things don't readily make sense to many students. For example, the ubiquitous use of the `self` statement, when to use it, how and why, etc. Further, it doesn't seem to make intuitive sense. Many other programming methods in Python have readily evident purposes. For example, looping through a list or even a binary search is readable, and even if it takes practice, the form and purpose of the code are relatively straightforward. This is often not the case with OOP. Further, it comes with many obscure definitions, which don't readily seem to make sense to many people trying to master this programming style.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this entry I'll try to help make sense of this form of programming and hope it helps somebody struggling with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key OOP Terms and Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class**\n",
    "A blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). A class defines attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    pass  # Defines a Car class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Object**\n",
    "An instance of a class. When a class is defined, objects can be created from it. Each object is unique but follows the structure defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_car = Car()  # Creates an instance (object) of the Car class`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attribute**\n",
    "A variable that belongs to an object or class. Attributes store the data related to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make  # 'make' is an attribute\n",
    "        self.model = model  # 'model' is an attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "*you make a thing, then you use the __init__ method to make that things attributes*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Method**\n",
    "A function that belongs to a class. Methods define the behavior of an object and can access or modify its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        return \"Car is starting\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`self`**\n",
    "A reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access the object's attributes and methods. It is passed automatically in method definitions and is used to refer to the object calling the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make):\n",
    "        self.make = make  # 'self' refers to the instance of Car\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Constructor (__init__)**\n",
    "A special method that is automatically called when a new object is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Encapsulation**\n",
    "The practice of keeping an object's data (attributes) safe from outside interference by controlling access to it. This is often done by using private and protected attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make):\n",
    "        self.__make = make  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Inheritance**\n",
    "A mechanism where one class (child or subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass), allowing code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class ElectricCar(Car):  # Inherits from Car class\n",
    "    def charge(self):\n",
    "        return \"Charging the electric car\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Polymorphism**\n",
    "The ability to define methods in different classes with the same name but different implementations. It allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly based on shared behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Bark\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Polymorphism in action*\n",
    "animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n",
    "for animal in animals:\n",
    "    print(animal.sound())  # Each object calls its own version of 'sound'\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Abstraction**\n",
    "The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. Abstraction is often used to create a simple interface for interacting with complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Inheritance (`super()`)**\n",
    "The `super()` function allows a child class to call a method from its parent class, enabling code reuse from the parent class while allowing the child class to add or modify functionality. You can essentially write less code when you use Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class ElectricCar(Car):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, battery):\n",
    "        super().__init__(make, model)  # Calls the parent class's __init__\n",
    "        self.battery = battery\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Private Attribute**\n",
    "An attribute that cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. In Python, private attributes are marked with a double underscore (`__`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make):\n",
    "        self.__make = make  # Private attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Public Attribute**\n",
    "An attribute that can be accessed from outside the class. In Python, public attributes do not have any special syntax and can be freely accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make):\n",
    "        self.make = make  # Public attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Protected Attribute**\n",
    "An attribute that is intended to be accessed only within the class and its subclasses. By convention, protected attributes are prefixed with a single underscore (`_`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make):\n",
    "        self._make = make  # Protected attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Instance**\n",
    "An object created from a class. Each instance has its own unique data but follows the structure defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")  # 'my_car' is an instance of the Car class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Instance Method**\n",
    "A method that operates on the attributes of a specific object (instance). It always takes self as its first parameter, which refers to the object calling the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.make} is driving\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **Class Method**\n",
    "A method that is bound to the class and not the object. It can modify class-level attributes. It is marked with the `@classmethod` decorator and takes `cls` (class itself) as the first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    count = 0  # Class attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def increment_count(cls):\n",
    "        cls.count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **Static Method**\n",
    "A method that does not modify object or class state. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class. It is marked with the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Math:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def add(a, b):\n",
    "        return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Duck Typing**\n",
    "A concept in Python where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. If an object has the required methods, it can be used in place of another object, regardless of its actual type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Duck:\n",
    "    def quack(self):\n",
    "        return \"Quack!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def quack(self):\n",
    "        return \"Person imitating a duck\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def make_it_quack(duck):\n",
    "    return duck.quack()  # Works with any object that has a quack() method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Learning OOP is important in Machine/Deep Learning\n",
    "The most obvious reason to learn how to code using OOP can be founs when using PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch can definitely be described as a framework that is heavily dependent on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Core Components are Classes**\n",
    "In PyTorch, almost everything is structured around classes and objects, which are key OOP principles. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tensors, the basic data structure in PyTorch, are instances of the `torch.Tensor` class. Each tensor object has attributes (like its shape or data type) and methods (like `.reshape()`, .`sum()`).\n",
    "```\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "x = torch.Tensor([1, 2, 3])  # Creates a tensor object (an instance of torch.Tensor)\n",
    "print(x.size())  # Calls a method on the tensor object\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Neural Networks: When building models, you typically subclass `torch.nn.Module`. Each model is an instance of a class, and layers are objects with their own attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import torch.nn as nn\n",
    "\n",
    "class SimpleModel(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()\n",
    "        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)  # Linear layer object as an attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        return self.fc(x)  # Forward pass as a method\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOP Concepts in PyTorch:\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch was developed primarily by Facebook's AI Research (FAIR) lab. It was first released publicly in 2016 as an open-source deep learning framework. PyTorch was originally a successor to Torch, a popular machine learning library that was based on the Lua programming language, but PyTorch was written in Python to cater to the larger Python-based data science and machine learning community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many OOP concepts are present in PyTorch:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encapsulation:** The properties of tensors, layers, and models are encapsulated within the respective classes. You interact with these components through well-defined methods, without worrying about internal implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inheritance:** You often define custom neural networks by inheriting from torch.nn.Module, extending it with your own layers and forward methods. This reuse of code is a core OOP practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class MyModel(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super(MyModel, self).__init__()\n",
    "        self.layer = nn.Linear(100, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        return self.layer(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Polymorphism:** Different layers (like `nn.Linear`, `nn.Conv2d`) share the same interface (i.e., they all have a `forward()` method) but implement different behaviors. This allows you to use them interchangeably while maintaining the same workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layers as Objects\n",
    "* In PyTorch, layers such as `nn.Linear` or nn.`Conv2d` are objects. These layers *encapsulate* both the weights and the behavior (the forward pass). You can add layers to your model by creating objects of these classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modularity and Composition\n",
    "* PyTorch’s OOP nature makes it highly modular. You can break down complex models into simple, reusable components (classes and objects), which can then be composed together into more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, a neural network model is often composed of multiple layers, each an object that manages its own weights and computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Management\n",
    "* Each object (like a model or layer) has its own state (e.g., the learned weights). This is a direct application of encapsulation—the state is stored inside the object, and you interact with it through methods (e.g., model.parameters() to get the model’s weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Modules and Loss Functions\n",
    "* When building custom neural networks or loss functions, you typically define them as subclasses of PyTorch’s base classes (like `torch.nn.Module` or `torch.autograd.Function`), extending or modifying their behavior, which is a hallmark of **inheritance** in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Custom Loss:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "class CustomLoss(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super(CustomLoss, self).__init__()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def forward(self, predictions, targets):\n",
    "        loss = (predictions - targets).abs().mean()  # Simple mean absolute error\n",
    "        return loss\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward and Backward Propagation as Methods\n",
    "* The computation graph in PyTorch is built dynamically, and the forward and backward passes are tied directly to the methods of the objects involved, using OOP to manage these processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*So as you can see, if you want to use PyTorch effectively, an understanding of OOP is critical. The good news is that OOP, with some persistence, can indeed be learned effectively. So read on!*\n",

    "### Why the `self`?\n",
    "* `self` represents the *instance* of the class. When you create an object from a class, *Python automatically passes the object itself as the first argument to any method. By convention, we name this first parameter `self`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simpler terms, when you create an object (e.g., `my_computer = Computer(\"MacBook-Pro\", \"M2-pro\")`), the `self` in the class methods refers to that specific object (my_computer).**\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "When you create the my_computer object, this happens:\n",
